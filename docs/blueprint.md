# **App Name**: Legal Decoder

## Core Features:

- Contract Upload and Extraction: Allow users to upload contracts in PDF, DOCX, or image format, and automatically extract the text content.
- Clause Detection and Labeling: Employ AI to detect and categorize clauses within the contract (e.g., confidentiality, liability, termination).
- Risk Scoring: Use AI to analyze each clause and assign a risk score (High, Medium, Low), providing a quick assessment of potential issues. The AI model should act as a tool by cross-referencing public legal datasets and offering a summary of findings.
- Plain English Summarization: Generate simplified explanations of legal terms and clauses, making the contract understandable for non-lawyers.
- AI Legal Chat: Implement a conversational AI interface that allows users to ask questions about the contract and receive context-aware answers.
- Analytics Dashboard: Display visual graphs and charts showing the distribution of clause types and risk levels within the contract.
- Clause Explorer: Integrate a learning hub where users can explore real-world contract clauses from a public dataset (e.g., Kaggle) and understand their implications.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A saturated blue (#29ABE2) to inspire trust and confidence in the application.
- Background color: A very light blue (#F0F8FF), nearly white, to provide a clean and professional backdrop.
- Accent color: A contrasting purple (#9C27B0) to draw attention to key elements and CTAs.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a sans-serif font, should be used because of its clean and modern aesthetic.
- Use a consistent set of icons throughout the app to represent different clause types and risk levels. Icons should be simple and easily recognizable.
- Design a clean, intuitive dashboard layout with clear sections for contract analysis, risk assessment, and AI chat. Use a card-based design for clause display.
- Incorporate subtle animations to enhance user experience (e.g., loading indicators, transitions between sections). Ensure animations are smooth and do not distract from the app's core functionality.
